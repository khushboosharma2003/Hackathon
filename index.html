                into
                their academic projects. Our goal is to create a common knowledge-sharing platform that encourages
                collaboration while ensuring academic integrity through built-in plagiarism detection.

                education
                institutions across the nation."

                This platform will serve as a valuable resource for the student community, enabling them to embark on
                unique
                and innovative projects while promoting academic excellence and integrity.
